## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **MetaMask** browser extension (for interacting with the DApp)

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-nft-dapp.git
cd real-estate-nft-dapp
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including Hardhat, Ethers.js, React, and testing libraries.

---

## 💻 Usage

### Development Workflow

#### 🧪 Run Tests

Ensure all smart contracts work as expected:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

#### 🌐 Start Local Blockchain

Launch a local Hardhat node:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Keep this terminal running throughout development.

#### 📝 Deploy Smart Contracts

In a new terminal, deploy contracts to the local network:

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

#### 🎨 Launch Frontend

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage for all smart contracts.

```bash
# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Run tests with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/RealEstate.test.js
```
